#### Description:

This chat room is a simple program in C programming language that you can run using the command line (command line). With this chat rom, you and other connected users can talk in a text chat room.

This chat uses TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the server. This means that in order to connect to the chat room, you need to know the IP address and the port on which the chat room program is running.

In general, the C command line chatroom consists of two main parts: a part you call "server" and another part called "client". As a user, you connect to the server and then you can talk to other clients in the chat room.

Since this C command line chat ROM is designed in a simple way, it might be a bit difficult for users who are familiar with command line and C language. But since the program code is very small and uses basic C libraries, I can easily understand it.
