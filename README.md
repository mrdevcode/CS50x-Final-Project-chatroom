This ROM chat is designed with command line, and to use it, you must first run the program from the command line. To do this, you need to go to the folder where the program is located and enter the "make" command in the command line.

To use the chat room, you need to enter the IP address and port of the server to connect to the chat room. Once connected, you can enter your username and join the chat room. With this, you can chat with other users in the shared space.

Using the "/help" command, you can access a list of commands. For example, with the command "/join" you can join a specific chat and with the command "/pm" you can send a private message to a specific user.

Another feature of this chat room is the ability to delete unwanted messages, the ability to send files and images, and the ability to use special chat between users.

This chat room is a computer program written using the C programming language and can be run from the command line. By using this chat room, users can communicate with each other in a common space.

To use this ROM chat, users must first run the program from the command line. After running the program, users need to enter the IP address and port of the server on which the chat room is running in order to connect to the chat room. Then by entering the user name, they can enter the chat room.

One of the features of this chat room is the special chat between users. Due to this feature, users can talk in a private space without other users knowing.

This chat uses the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the server and users' communications are encrypted through this protocol. Also, to prevent inappropriate access, there is the ability to create a user account with a username and password.

Since this chat rom is designed with command line, it may be difficult for users to use. But given the small and simple program code written in C language, I can make it easy and talk about it.

To start chatting, you and other users connected to this chat room must join the chat room and enter your messages. For this purpose, you can use your terminal program again and connect with C command. You can then enter your own messages and send them to other users in Chatrom.


This code makes a TCP connection to the server and receives a username from the user. Then, in the main loop of the program, it receives the user's input and sends it to the server.

Due to this code, it is not possible to send multiple users at the same time. For this, you should choose more complex methods such as similar strings or the use method.
